# This script is meant to include only libraries in the main hive package not already included in other hive subpackages.
# It does this by listing the contents of hive/lib into a temporary file and then it will
# lists all libs in in the .install files for other subpackages, adding those lines to a tmp exclude file
# It will then do a grep diff between the list of hive/lib and the exclude file and only include lines not found in the exclude
# It then reads what should be included to stdout as well as some files that should also be in the package, which is listed in hive.install.include.
