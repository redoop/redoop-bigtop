    <description>
       A list of command line options used for launching the Java Virtual
       Machine. The format of the file must be one option per line. These
       options are not interpreted by the shell, so options containing spaces or
       other special characters should not be quoted (as demonstrated by the
       OnOutOfMemoryError option).
