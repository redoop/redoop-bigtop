# Naming convention for flume agent config file is flume-${FLUME_AGENT_NAME}.conf
# For e.g. the FLUME_AGENT_NAME in this default config file is "agent" and  hence
# the config file is named flume-agent.conf. Multiple flume agents can be deployed 
# on a single node by creating config files with this naming convention and storing 
# it in /etc/flume/conf directory. Refer BIGTOP-1581 for details.
#
# To start|start|restart... a Flume agenti, user can issue the command
# service flume-agent start|stop|... FLUME_AGENT_NAME
#
# If FLUME_AGENT_NAME is not passed, action will be taken on all Flume agents for 
# which config file is stored in /etc/flume/conf directory
#

# Set name of flume agent (default: agent)
# FLUME_AGENT_NAME=agent

# Set name of flume configuration file (default: /etc/flume/conf/flume.conf)
# FLUME_CONF_FILE=/etc/flume/conf/flume.conf

# Set amount of time (in seconds) to wait for agent to shutdown gracefully
# If timeout is reached, then agent is force-killed.
# FLUME_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=60
