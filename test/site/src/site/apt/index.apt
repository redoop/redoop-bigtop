Welcome to iTest project
~~~~~

    The purpose of the project is to ease the development of stack validation
functionality and hide certain aspects of stack from development and quality
engineers alike and let them to focus on what they do best:
developing and testing a software.

    iTest introduces a necessary decoupling (along with proper versioning and
dependency tracing of test artifacts) between software product or component and
a test artifacts which are developed in order to test certain aspects of its
functionality.

    As of version 1.0 iTest provides means and helper functionality to bring
software stack testing to the next level where test functionality are defined
in a form of self-contained artifacts (including behavior and data, or
declaring dependency to versioned data).
