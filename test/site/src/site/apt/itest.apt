iTest project details

* iTest application scope

  iTest doesn't have narrowly defined scope of application. However, it is
reasonable to use for whatever from integration testing and higher in the chain:

  * integration

  * system

  * load

  * reliability

  * benchmarking

* iTest architecture

  The framework provides the following components:

  * shell support

    This module provides easy to use primitives to quickly execute a shell-out
    command or statement. Return code of the execution as well as content of
    standard input/error are available through properties.

  * package management support

    This module defines an abstract set of commands to work with native Linux
    packages (deb, rpm, etc.) and some concrete implementations. A user can
    write a test code which manipulates with native packages - install, remove,
    update, etc. - which will work on any of supported platforms.

  * jar utils

    The module implements certain helper functionality to ease manipulations with
    jar files (such as Maven artifacts).

* iTest technology

  iTest is written in {{{http://groovy.codehaus.org}Groovy}}

  iTest facilitate certain operations for Maven based projects. However, it isn't
  specific to Maven and can be used as a standalone framework.
