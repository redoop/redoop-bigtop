      <question>What is iTest?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          iTest is a library providing a set of highly useful primitives to enable
          seamless deployment, execution, dependency tracking, and reports
          gathering for software validation.
        </p>
        <p>
          iTest works on top of JVM platform, using Groovy for most of its
          implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          iTest bridges certain gaps between Maven and available test frameworks
          such as JUnit and TestNG to allow better system and integration testing
          experience.

      <question>Where I can download iTest?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          iTest comes in two forms: binary Maven artifact (basically a jar file)
          and as a source code. The latter can be used for development and or as
          a reference material. Whether the former is intended for use in the
          field i.e. for testing/deployment automation.
