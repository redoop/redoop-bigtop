Bigtop's approach to running CI off of Jenkins is simple: we use
Groovy DSL Job plugin extensively so that Jenkins configuration
can be as stateless as possible. All we require from a Jenkins
admin is that the following plugins are installed:
   * Amazon EC2 Plugin
   * Credentials Plugin
   * Disk Usage Plugin
   * DynamicAxis Plugin
   * Git Plugin
   * Gradle plugin
   * Hudson Extended Read Permission Plugin
   * Job DSL Plugin
   * Mailer
   * Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin
   * Matrix Project Plugin
   * Matrix Reloaded Plugin
   * Parameterized Trigger Plugin
   * SSH Credentials Plugin
   * SSH Slaves plugin
   * Timestamper

Once you have all the above plugins installed, all you have to do in
order to start Bigtop CI is to create one Bootstrap job. Pick a type
of 'Build a free-style software project' when asked by Jenkins and 
hook it up to Bigtop's Git repo. Then select 'Process Job DSLs' as 
one and only build step, pointing it at 
   bigtop-ci/jenkins/jobsCreator.groovy
as a DSL script that needs to be looked up in the filesystem.

That is it! You only need to run it now in order to have all
the required Jenkins jobs.
